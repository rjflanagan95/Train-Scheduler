# Train-Scheduler

This page uses a Firebase database to store train departure information. Trains can be added using the input form below the table, or removed using the "Remove Train" button.

Future ideas for development include:
~"Update Train" button
~Sorting trains so that the nearest departure appears at the top of the table
